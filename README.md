In this project the goal is to develop a code that helps the user figure out where to go on vacation based on what type of vacation they want, with whom they are going, how many and what type of group it is, 
the budget and the length of their stay. When it has done this it will give a list of reasons why that is a good place to vacation. It also tells the user how you could best get there, based on travel time, 
distance and the carbon footprint it leaves behind. It also compares the different types of transport so the user can make an educated decision on how they want to travel based on what they deem important.

The algorithm will filter out destinations based on the user input then asses transport, travel time, distance and etc.. Based on that it will suggest a destination and way of travel. 
To do this the pandaâ€™s library can be used to filter data on destinations such as costs and travel options. Geopy can be used to determine distance and travel time. 
Datatime can be used to manage the travel time aspect And optimization to determine the most suitable travel option.

Data about the temperature of countries, common activities/ vacation types, mean length of stay, ways to travel from destinations, sustainability of travel ways based on duration and distance. 
I expect that the outcome is a system that can advice on vacation locations at least within Europe based on preferences put in by the user that might also be able to advice on best way to travel based on 
sustainability and travel preference.
